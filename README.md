## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a program that displays a team's basic info , given some information from the user.

Program runs exclusively in the terminal, and builds a HTML/CSS page for output.

User input processed using [the Inquirer npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Tests were run using [jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).

Through this project, I learnt more about Javascript, working with npm, inquirer, jest, and how to ensure a program's logic is as sharp as possible.

## Installation

Ensure that [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed, and that you have access to the relevant terminal on your OS. 
This application was also developed using the [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) terminal, and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the IDE of choice.

## Usage

To use the program, run 'node (insert file pathway to index.js file) in the terminal. You will then be prompted for information regarding the team you wish to build the display for.

The program will first ask for information regarding the team manager (and also assumes there is only one team manager). After which, it will give the user the option to add an intern/engineer to the team, or finish and build the webpage.

After the user chooses to finish, the webpage will be built under output/team.html, and the display can be opened in a browser of the user's choosing.
